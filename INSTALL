Build instructions for libsomanetwork. 

NOTE: In general, you should use one of the pre-built debs for most
Soma software, including this library.

You will need to have automake on your system as well as Boost
1.34.1. These packages are available from the Ubuntu 8.04
package archive.

In general: 

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

should do what you want.
