Build instructions for libsomanetwork. 

NOTE: In general, you should use one of the pre-built debs for most
Soma software, including this library.

BUILD REQUIREMENTS:
cmake
Boost 1.37.0
sigc++-2.0 for the benchmarks

These packages are available from the Ubuntu package archive.

CMake
------------------------------
We use cmake to build the source

http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/CMake_Useful_Variables

If you want to do the equivalent of "./configure --prefix=$FOO" 
run "cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$FOO". 

Typically, building can be accomplished with : 

[note the period after cmake]

cmake .
make
make test
sudo make install
