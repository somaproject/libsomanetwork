The Synthetic Soma benchmark attempt... an out-of-process data
transmission interface that should ideally be maximally threaded and
transmit a ton of UDP data ASAP

Right now we transmit identical data

We support sending between 0 and 63 TSPIKEs at ideally 1 kHz
We also send event packets with timing data, optionally

The tough part will be internally rate-metering our TX rate. Oh, and set
the process priority to real time. 

P-code:

start N threads
for each thread
get time of day
send packet

thread groups are always at the same rate

--tspike=0-15 --tspikerate=1000
--wave=0-12 --waverate=100

--threads = # of threads

--tgtip == target IP

-- how to handle retx requests? Just a separate individual thread
