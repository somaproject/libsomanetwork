We want to make it easy to debug the soma network library if
necessary. We use the pre-release Boost Logging Library v2. 

We use the following log levels: 

debug: Almost all socket and buffer operations

info: setup, teardown, and configuration

warning : Information like packets being dropped are logged

error : Severe problems that will significantly impact functionality

To initialize the default logger, call:

somanetwork::init_logs()

which will by default dump to standard out. To set the logging level, include
<somanetwork/logging.h> and call : 

somanetwork_log_level()->set_enabled(level::error);

note that this is -outside- of the somanetwork:: namespace, due to issues
with the boost logging library.
