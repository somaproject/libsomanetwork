For the time being we simply pass up all events. This will, at a
minimum, be the clock events.

What should we pass up? individual events? event packets? Should the higher level have to extract out event sets? (no)

So we will pass up a _pointer_ to a std::vector of events, which we're calling an EventList_t. 

The path is something like this:

buffer of char
  to
EventPacket_t  (which has a pointer to the extracted EventList_t as well as the sequence /missing data)
  to 
passing up the contained eventList_t


This is just for event RX; the protocol is very similar to the data
receiver interface. We take in an epollFD, set it up, register our
data handler as the callback, and take a pointer to where we should
eventually deposit the events.
