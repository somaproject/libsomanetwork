This is a thread-safe fifo with a pipe that clients can block/wait on.
It's templatized. 

TSPipeFifo<T> has:

append(T x):  copy x into the internal fifo

T pop(): return a copy of the head of the fifo, and remove it from the head. 

internally this is implemented by a list that we push_back onto, which is mutex-protected via RAII
